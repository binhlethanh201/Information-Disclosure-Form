# Information Disclosure Form

This repository contains a simple React application for collecting and displaying information about individuals, including their name, birthdate, teaching quality rating, and selected courses. The app features a user-friendly form and a table that lists submitted information. It is ideal for learning or demonstrating basic React form handling and layout with Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- (Optional) A code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom for easier code navigation

## How to Run
